This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  For example:

```javascript
const myObject = null;
console.log(myObject.someProperty); // TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'someProperty')
```

This frequently happens when dealing with asynchronous operations where data hasn't fully loaded yet.  In React Native, common scenarios include fetching data from an API or accessing props before they've been passed down.

# React Native: Handling 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '...')'

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development: the `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '...')` error. This error occurs when you attempt to access a property of an object that is currently `null` or `undefined`.  This is often the result of asynchronous operations where data hasn't yet been fully loaded.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, demonstrating effective error handling techniques using optional chaining and the nullish coalescing operator.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the error in the original code and the corrected behavior in the solution.
